# game-inventory-system

Small library providing the logic and functionality of an inventory/bag system of a video game. The goal is to have great abstraction that allows working with different inventory requirements, but at first and to have a good path to follow, the focus will be on successfully replicating the World of Warcraft inventory system.

This is work in progress.
